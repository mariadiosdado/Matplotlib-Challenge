# Matplotlib-Challenge
Module 5 Challenge
For this challenge I received help from my tutor who helped me clean the data and organize it. Also from google and the class notes. Classmates were also there to answer some questions.

In this challenge we analyzed a group of 249 mice who were being treated with different drugs. In the first step, we got excluded one mouse that had repeated IDs and Timepoints. That left only 248 mice to analyze. We then, did statistical analysis and got the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and sem of the tumor for each treatment regimen. We displayed the data in a bar chart. Then we also created a pie chart displaying the average of males vs females mice. The result was 51% males vs 49% females. After that, we narrowed down the data to only 4 drugs and calculated the final tumor volume at the last timepoint. We calculated IQR and displayed the findings in a boxplot which clearly showed outliers. Then we focused one drug (Capomulin ) and one specific mouse (I509) and displayed the timepoint vs tumor volume in a line graph. The results were promising as the tumor decreased with treatment time for Capomulin treatment. Finally, a scatter point plot was created to show the relationship between weight and tumor volume for the whole Capomulin regimen. A regression line was calculated and showed a positive correlation between mice weight and tumor volume.
